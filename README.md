# Motorized Macro Rail Hardware
## WARNING: The design is unverified at the time of writing 
## Summary
PCB-design for controlling a motorized macro rail. Features:
- Flexible solution for connecting to most types of camera with remote triggering ability via 2.5mm stereo jack, pin header, or solder joints.
- Simple design for driving a single motor via a TCM2209 V1.2 motor driver.
- Based on the WiFi-enabled NodeMCU 32S V2 DevKit. 
- Zero surface mount components, and should therefore be possible to hand solder - even for people with novice soldering skills. 
- Has broken out headers for connecting limit switches and rotary encoders (neither of which are used in the intended application the board was designed for).
- Total cost of around $30 (Camera, optics, motor, slider, and tools not included)

## Configurability
The design is quite adaptable in general, and there are few components that are completely necessary for functioning (see the section "Minimum viable design"). There is however one part of the circuit that is particularly adaptable, and requires the users attention to guarantee a working configuration: the shutter control circuit - which depends on what kind of camera you are planning to control with this setup.

Snippet of schematic (DNP = Do Not Place):

As shown in the image above, there is a lot going on for what is normally a very simple circuit (you can trigger many cameras by simply short-circuiting all the pins in the remote shutter connector with a piece of wire). The reason for all this additional complexity is to keep the design as flexible as possible, and hopefully allow the PCB to be used with any type of camera. This is obviously not possible for me to test out in person, so I'm basing most of what follows on [this blog-post by GÃ¼nter from LRTimelapse](https://lrtimelapse.com/news/intervalometer-hack/) (which is based on feedback from a solid photographer community) and private conversations with Stefan from [CNCKitchen](https://www.youtube.com/CNCKitchen) (as he owns a camera not mentioned in the above blog-post).

All the extra nick-nack is an attempt to solve the following design-requirements:
1. Different cameras require different signals to trigger
    - Example: 
        - Canon requires Shutter and GND to be shorted
        - Nikon/Sony requires Shutter, Focus and GND to be shorted
        - Lumix requires a [resistor network](https://i1.wp.com/fluxing.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/arduino-panasonic-lumix-shutter-schematic.jpg) between Shutter and GND.
2. Different cameras may swap the layout of Shutter and Focus signals on the 2.5mm jack
3. The user may not own a connector with a 2.5mm jack, so a pin header/2.54mm pitch solder joint option is also provided.
4. The high currents drawn by the motor may cause noise on the PCB, so therefore the shutter circuit is optically isolated from the rest of the electronics to avoid unintended triggering of the camera shutter.

The following components are layed out in the design solely to handle requirements 1. and 2.
- SJ1, SJ2, SJ3
- R2, R3 (Note: These are, to my knowledge, only required by Lumix - and should not be mounted by default)

The solder jumpers (SJ1-3) are there to give the user an opportunity to make permanent (but recoverable) changes to the circuit. The way this works is that each SJ consists of two exposed copper pads with a small trace connecting the pads. Cutting the trace with a scalpel will remove the connection between the pads, but it is still possible to recover this connection by applying a bit of solder as a bridge between the pads (in case the user buys a new camera, or just cut the wrong wire).

### An example of how to use solder jumpers:
Suppose your camera starts updating the screen each time the autofocus-signal is activated (even in manual focus mode), so you want to stop that signal from being activated each time a picture is captured. In this scenario, you can use a scalpel to break the wire connecting the two pads of SJ2 by cutting along the red arrow in the following picture: 
![How-to-cut-SJ2](./Outputs/Images/Documentation/cut_trace.png)

### Default configuration (Canon,Nikon,Sony):
The default configuration requires you to not mount R2 and R3. The pads on all the solder jumpers are shorted by default, meaning that a simplified schematic of the circuit looks like this:
![Default-config](./Outputs/Images/Documentation/Illustration-of-shutter-circuit-default.png)
This should work for all Canon, Nikon, and Sony cameras.

### Lumix configuration:
To use the shutter circuit with a Lumix camera, the resistor network must be mounted (R2 and R3). Keep in mind that SJ1 is shorted by default, meaning that it needs to be cut in order for R2 to take any effect.

Mount R2 and R3, then use a scalpel to break the wire in SJ1 by cutting along the red arrow in this picture.
![Lumix-config-modification](./Outputs/Images/Documentation/Lumix_config.png)
Cutting this wire will activate R2 and leave you with the following schematic:
